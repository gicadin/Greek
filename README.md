This is a PHP website with a front end and a CMS backend for administrator.

The backend username and password is: admin / admin

The website is structured using object oriented MVC and my own implementation of Restfull architecture. 

The models are the individual classes: Item.php etc...

All the views are in the views/ subdirectories

Controllers are scattered inside the models and are individual functions named controller
